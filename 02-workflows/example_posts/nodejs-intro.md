# Getting Started with Node.js: A Beginner’s Guide

Node.js has become one of the most popular runtime environments for building scalable, fast, and efficient web applications. If you're a JavaScript developer, learning Node.js opens the door to full-stack development without switching languages.

## What is Node.js?

At its core, Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine**. It allows developers to run JavaScript outside of the browser, enabling server-side programming. Thanks to its **non-blocking I/O model**, Node.js is ideal for applications that require high concurrency, like chat apps, APIs, and real-time collaboration tools.

## Why Use Node.js?

- **Single Language for Frontend and Backend**: Use JavaScript everywhere.
- **Asynchronous and Fast**: Perfect for I/O heavy apps like APIs and streaming.
- **Vast Ecosystem**: With npm, you get access to millions of packages.
- **Scalability**: Designed for building applications that handle large amounts of requests.

## Installing Node.js

To get started, download the LTS (Long Term Support) version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).  
Verify the installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
