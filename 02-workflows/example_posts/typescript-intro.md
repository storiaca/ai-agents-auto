# Why Every JavaScript Developer Should Learn TypeScript

JavaScript is powerful and flexible, but with great flexibility comes unexpected bugs. That’s where **TypeScript** comes in. TypeScript is a **superset of JavaScript** that adds static typing, making your code more predictable, maintainable, and scalable.

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is developed and maintained by Microsoft. It extends JavaScript with **type annotations**, **interfaces**, and **strong tooling support**. The code you write in TypeScript is compiled down to plain JavaScript, which means it works anywhere JavaScript runs.

Example comparison:

```js
// JavaScript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

add("5", 10); // returns "510" — unexpected!
```
